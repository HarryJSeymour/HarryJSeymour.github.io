			<span class="v1">|</span>
			Aspiring software engineer targeting Level 6 Software apprenticeship. I’ve completed Year 1 of BSc Computer Science (HNC equivalent) and built small but complete projects across Android (Java), functional programming (Haskell), and CLI tooling (Java), with demo videos and GitHub repos. 
			I learn fastest by building: clear docs, disciplined Git, and simple, working software. I also bring reliability and customer focus from long-term retail experience at Sainsbury’s. I’m looking to contribute to a team, grow through structured training, and complete the degree while delivering value.
