			<h>About Me</h>
			<hr class="v1">
			<p>Aspiring software engineer targeting entry level roles as well as Level 4/6 Software apprenticeship. I’ve completed Year 1 of BSc Computer Science (CertHE equivalent) and built small but complete projects across Android (Java), functional programming (Haskell), and CLI tooling (Java), with demo videos and GitHub repos. </p> <br>
			<p>I learn fastest by building: clear docs, disciplined Git, and simple, working software. I also bring reliability and customer focus from long-term retail experience at Sainsbury’s. I’m looking to contribute to a team, grow through structured training, and complete the degree while delivering value. </p>
